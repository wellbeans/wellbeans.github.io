A simple starter kit using Gulp, Stylus, Boy, Jeet, Rupture, Autoprefixer, BrowerSync, and error handling.

### First-time Installation
You have to have NPM and Gulp installed globally.
Open a command-line or terminal in the root folder and type 'npm install'. After a short while a folder called 'node_modules' will appear in the root folder.

### Usage
Open a command-line or terminal in the root folder and type 'gulp'. A browser window will open with your index.html file, and you'll be able to see changes to your Stylus files as you save them.
